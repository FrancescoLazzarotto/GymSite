# Web Technologies Project: Advanced Approaches â€“ Full Stack Development of a Dynamic Gym Management System
This repository serves as an update to another university project at the link: https://github.com/FrancescoLazzarotto/GymSite-and-Managment-System

This project focuses on building a comprehensive gym management system using a full stack approach, integrating modern web development technologies. The system will provide an interactive platform for both gym members and administrators, leveraging a secure and scalable architecture.

Key Technologies & Features:
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Back-End: PHP with an object-oriented approach, ensuring modular and maintainable code.
Database Management: MySQL with PDO (PHP Data Objects) for secure database interactions, protecting against SQL injection.
RESTful API & AJAX: Enabling seamless communication between the front-end and back-end, providing real-time updates without page reloads.
Security Enhancements: Password hashing and secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data.
System Overview:
User Interface (Members)
Course Registration & Management: Users can browse available gym courses, register, and manage their enrollments dynamically.
Real-Time Updates: Course availability and schedules are fetched from the database dynamically using AJAX requests.
Support Requests: Users can submit support tickets for assistance, enhancing communication with gym staff.
Admin Interface
Course Management: Administrators can create, update, and delete courses, modifying details like schedules, instructors, and availability.
User Registration Oversight: Gym admins can monitor and manage user enrollments, ensuring course limits are enforced.
Support Request Handling: Admins can review and respond to user queries through a structured ticketing system.
Dynamic Content & Automation:
Database-Driven Architecture: The system pulls and updates content dynamically, ensuring that schedules, user interactions, and registrations are always synchronized.
Performance Optimization: Efficient SQL queries and API calls are used to minimize server load and improve responsiveness.
